A person can create a flower bouquet with either 3 roses (cost of bouquet = p) or 1 rose and 1 lily (cost = q) 
In an array of flowers, the person has to select contiguous set of flowers i.e. 2 or 3 to gain maximum cost.

Output: 5

Solution:
if three consecutive 0's:
              dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], p + dp[i-3])
          else if 1, 0 or 0, 1:
              dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], q + dp[i-2])
          
          return dp[n-1]
