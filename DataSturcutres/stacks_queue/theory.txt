Queue:
Operations: 
    - Enqueue: add an element at tail
    - Dequeue: Remove from head
Implimentation:
        from queue import Queue
        q = Queue(maxsize = 3)      
        print(q.qsize())
        q.put('a')
        q.put('b')
        q.put('c')
        print("\nFull: ", q.full())
        print(q.get())
        print(q.get())
        print(q.get())
        print("\nEmpty: ", q.empty())

Circular queue is better.
front = rear = -1 : at start
for one element: front = rear = 0
Enqueue: rear = (rear + 1) % N
Dequeue: Front = (front + 1) % N
