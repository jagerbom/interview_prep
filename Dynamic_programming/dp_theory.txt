How to identify a DP problem?
    1) A DP problem will be of the follwoing format.
    What is the minimum cost of doing...
    What is the maximum profit from...
    How many ways are there to do...
    What is the longest possible...
    Is it possible to reach a certain point...
    
    2) A certain state will depend on the answers to previous state

Top down and bottom up:
    Bottom UP: Iteration starts form base cases. expmple we will know dp(0) and dp(1) and will calculate dp(3) based on these two.
    Bottom up is usually faster and uses array and loops

    Top Down: Uses recursion and hash maps. calculated top results first

What are the steps for solving a DP problem
1) A function or data structure that will compute/contain the answer to the problem for every given state. we need to decide the arguments to this function
2) Find the recurrance relationsship. example f(i) = f(i-1) + f(i-2)
3) Find base cases: for example, f(0) = 0, f(1) = 1 f(2) = 1
