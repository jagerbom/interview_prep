what will happen when you type google.com in browser:
Answer:
1. DNS lookup happens in following sequense till the correct IP address is found (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdTgpAz0qq7iollff0Yk_v-1qKosrIFkO)
    - lookup in browser cache 
    - lookup in OS cache (/etc/hosts in linux)
    - lookup in the DNS (layer 7 protocol, DNS uses UDP) server configured on the router, this is ISP DNS server. (99.99 % of times we will find the ip here)
    - lookup in the globally allocated dns servers (13 currently), there will be top level domain DNS servers which inturn will tell us about the correct DNS server to query

2. Client makes a TCP connection with the server  (Can explain SSL also)
3. Once TCP is established, the client sends a HTTP GET request
4. server sends out a HTTP response
5. browser displays the content

How can you port a product to cloud:
ANSWER:
1. Level of integration?
    - shallow -> make only necessary changes to the application, so that it is able to run in cloud.
    - deep -> make major changes in application to use cloud specific features.
2. Single cloid or multi cloud.
    - single cloud -> choose a cloud and shift there, it is easy but the disadvantages are less flexibility
    - Multi Cloud -> different ways, 1. parts of applications in different cloud 2. different apps in diff clouds etc
3. Establish KPIs
    - user experiance
    - performance
    - infra
    - business engagement
4. establish performance baseline
5. Prioritise migration components ->  which components will you migratae first
6. perform necessary refractoring
7. Data migration plan -> how will you migrate the data
8. Switch over to production -> few customers at a time or all at once
9. Review application resource allocation ->
